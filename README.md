# tem (Tagged Editor for Markdown)

I wanted to build my own system for markdown text editing. I didn't want to rely on traditional interfaces like Electron with web; instead, I decided to choose GTK for a balance between ease of use and low-level performance.

## Tech used

- Rust
- GTK4
- [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/introduction.html)
