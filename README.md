# tem (Tagged Editor for Markdown)

I wanted to build my own system for markdown text editing. I didn't want to rely on traditional interfaces like Electron with web; instead, I decided to choose GTK for a balance between ease of use and low-level performance.

Although there are solutions out there (Google Drive, Obsidian, Vi), none of them were perfectly suited to my use case (Obsidian came close but it isn't open source sad face).
